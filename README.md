# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
This project was taken on to help SellBy break down, filter, and count reviews on a certain product category. In this case, video games. This data will be used to help SellBy know what products are preferred compared to others as well as see what buyers liked and disliked about the products reviewed. 

## Results 
After cleaning and filtering the data, the results show there are 4291 Vine reviews and 1781706 non-Vine reviews 
The amount of five-star reviews that have Vines are 1607 and for five-stars that are non-Vines is 75638.
Looking at the percentages of five star revies, five-star Vine reviews comes to 37% and for non-Vine five-star reviews, the percentage is 57%.

##Summary

Based on the data found, and seeing that there are still so many more non-Vine five stars, there does not seem to be a positive bias towards reviews with Vines giving five stars. 
The logic is, if someone likes a product enough to do a Vine review, they are more likely to also give it five stars. But seeing as only 37% of vine reviews that were given five stars, and then is compared to 57% of non-Vine 5 stars, it seems to not be the case. And with such a smaller population, it is even more supportive there is not a bias. 
To further review this idea, it would be best to see if the same pattern is seen in other categories. We could even keep the products similar by specifically using the digital games category data that was on of the 50 available datasets.
